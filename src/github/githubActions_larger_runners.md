# 🌐 GitHub is using GitHub Actions and Larger Runners to enhance continuous integration (CI)

🛠️ Let's explore how this is transforming development on GitHub!

🧠 History

- 🔄 GH has invested in different IC systems.
- 🚧 Faced challenges to scale and provide stable and ephemeral build environments.
- 🆕 With the arrival of Larger Runners, a new opportunity arose to develop and experiment with more robust systems.

🏃 ♂️ What are Larger Runners?

- 🌐 They are GitHub Actions runners hosted by GitHub.
- 🖥️ Managed VMs with more RAM, CPU, and disk space.
- 📈 Available to GitHub Team and GitHub Enterprise Cloud customers.

🌟 Why Larger Runners?

- 📏 Autoscaling and management.
- 🚀 Allows you to create CI machines on demand.
- 📊 It utilizes 4,500 competing 32-core runners, running 15,000 jobs in an hour with 150,000 computing colors!

🛠️ (Beta) Custom VM Image Support

- 📦 Allows you to group all the necessary software and tools.
- 🚀 Accelerates GitHub Actions workflows.
- 🔄 Regular updates keep the project code up to date.

🔄 Reusable Workflows

- 🌐 Facilitates centralized management of workflows.
- 📈 Essential for the transition to GitHub Actions.
- 🖥️ Allows you to define the runner in the Reusable Workflow, ensuring that the designated runner pool is used.

🌟 (Beta) Reusing Results from Previous Workflows

- 🚀 Allows you to reuse the result of a previous workflow when the contents are identical.
- 🕒 Saves time by avoiding running 300-500 workflows per day!

🛡️ Access to Private Services

- 🌐 Some workflows need to access private GitHub services.
- 🚀 A remote access solution has been developed to enable secure access.
- 📦 The GitHub for this solution is in the github/actions-oidc-gateway-example repository

🎉 Conclusion

- 🌐 GitHub Actions provides a robust and smooth developer experience.
- 🚀 Using Larger Runners and reusable workflows, GitHub is optimizing development.
- 🌟 In short, GitHub runs on GitHub!
